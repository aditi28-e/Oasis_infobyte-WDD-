                            Indian Army is divided into seven command regions, basic field formation being a division. Under these divisions lies 
                            the regiment, which is permanent in nature. Each regiment is responsible for the recruitment and training of its soldiers.
                             Each of the units and regiment of the Indian Army has its own history and achievements, within and outside of India, before
                              1947. More than 80% of the active defence officers are in the Army, which is an all-volunteer force. Being one of the
                               largest standing armies in the world, the Indian Army has 960,000 reserve troops and 1,237,117 active troops, according 
                               to reports. At present, the Ministry of Defence is looking forward to the infantry modernization program of the Army, 
                               which is popularly known as the Futuristic Infantry Soldier As System (F-INSAS). It is also enhancing and obtaining newer 
                               assets for its artillery, armoured and aviation branches.The army has embarked
                            on an infantry modernisation program known as Futuristic Infantry Soldier As a System (F-INSAS), and is also upgrading and 
                            acquiring new assets for its armoured, artillery, and aviation branches.

                            The Indian Army, till now, has fought four battles, from which three were with Pakistan, and one was with China.
                            Some other operations that are performed by the Indian Army are Operation Vijay, Operation Meghdoot, Operation Cactus,
                            and Operation Brasstacks. One can also learn about some more missions conducted by the Army from this essay on the
                            Indian Army, as they were also involved in many peacekeeping missions organized by the United States. Some of these 
                            peacekeeping missions were conducted in Lebanon, Angola, Cambodia, Vietnam, and many other countries.

                            The Indian Army gives the perfect example of gender inequality by recruiting women in different regiments of the Army.
                            The first women were appointed in the Indian Army when the Indian Military Nursing Service was formed in the year 1888.
                            These women nurses have served the Army in both World War I and II.

                        As already said, it was unified as the Indian Army by the Britishers in 1885. Till then, it was under their command as their
                        Presidency army. However, the Military Department was created by the East India Company's government earlier in 1776 itself.
                        The military department in the East India Company kept records of the orders issued to the Army by various departments of 
                        governance.
                        After 1947, four out of ten Gurkha Regiments were sent to the British Army, and the rest Indian Army was divided into India 
                        and Pakistan. A Punjab Boundary Force was formed to help the police of Punjab during the partition, and later, it got 
                        disbanded. The departure of all the Britishers after independence replaced the higher ranks with the Indian officers, such 
                        as S. M. Shrinagesh, who was a major general and went on to become the third Chief of Army Staff (COAS).    
                        Every year on 15 January, India celebrates its Army Day. This day marks the takeover of Lieutenant General K. M. Cariappa as
                        the first commander-in-chief of the Indian Army in 1949. The last English commander-in-chief of India was General Sir
                        Francis Butcher, and Cariappa's tenure was posted with effect from the first Republic Day.

                Oh Soldiers! I don't have words to thank you. It's their selfless love towards our nation that makes them to offer the supreme
                sacrifice for us! It's their bravery, courage, best skills, perfection and Excellency that makes them special and eligible to 
                serve our motherland. 

                World's 4th largest and powerful military that is our Indian Defence Forces works in one of the world's toughest battle fields.
                They serve our country in extreme conditions. They are our real heroes. Presently it is one of the top militaries of the world 
                and also having a glorious and decent history too!

                They sacrifice everything for us and our country. They leave their family, friends, home and all the comfort for securing our 
                comfort. We Indians mostly forget their supreme sacrifice and never try to understand their emotions and feelings. It’s our 
                biggest fault. We should be thankful for everything they do for us. We are not at all that great, we cannot afford to pay the 
                debt of their service and sacrifice! 

                Our great soldiers are the back bone of our country.

                <p>
                    We sleep comfortably in our homes because we know that even if we are not alert, there are some people who are always aware so that
                    we can be safe. These people are part of the country's Army. Likewise, the Indian Army is known all over the world for its strength,
                    which is dedicated to protecting Indians from dangers. It was known as British Indian Army prior to 1947 (before India's Independence). 
                    The British Indian Army was founded on April 01, 1895, along with the East India Company's presidency army. However, the Indian Army was 
                    later included in the presidency army in 1903. At that time, the princely states had their armies, which then got merged into the national
                    Army after the liberation. In India, the Army got formerly established on January 26, 1950, which was the first Republic Day. Its colour,
                    gold, red and black, depicts its great strength in itself. "Service Before Self", translated in Hindi as "???? ???? ????:", is the sole
                    motto of this force. It is at present headquartered in the Integrated Defence Headquarters at the Ministry of Defence, New Delhi. </p>
